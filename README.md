# Frontend to replicate design 

Here I use react js and try to create all the components to be reusable.
name of these compnents are
1. Heading
2. Button
3. Paragraph
4. ListComponents (Cards)

All of there are use together and I pass their values as props.
Also, list data is stored in a seprate file and then use a map unction to render all of them on screen.

That's a short intro about this repo if you find any bug or any enhancement area feel free to create a PR's.
Thank you. ( राम रामा जी। )
